 This repository houses a unique data science project that utilizes Streamlit, an open-source app framework, to analyze biological sequences.

Our application takes FASTA sequences as input, a widely used data format for nucleotide and protein sequences. The beauty of this application lies in its ability to provide comprehensive insights into these sequences. Offering a detailed analysis that can be invaluable in bioinformatics research.

The application is designed with user-friendliness in mind. It allows users to easily input their FASTA sequences and presents the analysis in an intuitive and interactive manner. This makes it a powerful tool not just for seasoned researchers, but also for those new to the field.

what is FASTA format?
FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which base pairs or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. 
A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data.
